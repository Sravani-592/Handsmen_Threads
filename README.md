# HandsMen Threads Salesforce Project

## Project Overview

**HandsMen Threads**, a dynamic organization in the fashion industry, is launching a Salesforce project aimed at transforming its data management and enhancing customer relationships. This initiative focuses on building a robust and scalable data model to store critical business information and ensure smooth information flow across departments.

## Key Features and Business Processes
